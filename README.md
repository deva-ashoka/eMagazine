# eMagazine
As the title suggests this basically an online magazine. 
The main sections of the magazine are: Events, Newsfeed, Other Stories, Miscellaneous, Most Read Articles and Advertisements.

Events: Each event has a title, image and content. Only fist 60-80 words are displayed on the main page and when by clicking on 'read more', the whole event pops up. There are 5 such events.

Newsfeed: This can be links to other web pages or attachments such as PDF etc.

Other Stories: Some news in that particular ULB/district/state. 

Miscellaneous: Contains fun facts, health tips, interesting articles etc. Mostly links and attachments.

Most Read Articles: Mostly links or newspaper cuttings that are uploaded here.

There is one eMagazine for every ULB, one for every district and one for the state. A non-technical person can keep this systems running. The user at every level (ULB/District/MRC) can login and create new editions and the superuser (only 1 per state) publishes them after checking the edition. The previous editions are also archived.
